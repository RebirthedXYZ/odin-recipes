    <p>Goat cheese is baked with marinara sauce and topped with fresh basil to make this super easy appetizer in a flash! Serve fresh out of the oven with crostini or garlic bread for dipping.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 (8 ounce) goat cheese log
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cups marinara sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt (optional)
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup fresh basil, cut into ribbons
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step 1 </strong> <br> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step 2 </strong> <br>  Press goat cheese to fit the shape of a small baking dish, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge. Gently spoon marinara sauce around the border, taking care to cover the edge of goat cheese but not the middle. Sprinkle with salt. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step 3 </strong> <br>  Bake in the preheated oven until goat cheese is hot and soft and marinara sauce is hot and bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step 4 </strong> <br>  Remove from the oven and sprinkle with freshly chopped basil. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
